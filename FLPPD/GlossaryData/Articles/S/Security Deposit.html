<h1>Security Deposit</h1>
<p>Money a tenant gives a landlord at the beginning of the tenancy to protect the landlord in case the tenant fails to comply with the terms of the lease; the landlord may retain all or part of the deposit to cover unpaid rent or repair costs at the end of the tenancy. According to the Minnesota Landlord-Tenant Act, a security deposit is any deposit of money the function of which is to secure the performance of a residential rental agreement (not including an advance payment of rent).</p>
