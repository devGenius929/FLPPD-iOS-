<h1>Value, Market</h1>
<p>The most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. (This is the definition from the Uniform Standards of Appraisal Practice.) Sometimes called value in exchange or objective value. Compare: Market Price.</p>
