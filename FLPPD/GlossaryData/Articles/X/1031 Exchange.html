<h1>1031 Exchange</h1>
<p>A Transaction that allows you to defer capital gains taxes on profit realized from the sale of an asset such as real estate when that profit is reinvested in a "like-kind exchange": real estate for real estate. Both the old property and the new property must be held for investment purposes and not be personal residences. The tax code also states that any proceeds must be reinvested within 180 days after the sale and that the new property must be identified in 45 days.</p>
