<h1>Debt Ratio (DR, D:I)</h1>
<p>Also known as debt to income. The ratio of the total of minimum monthly debt payments to gross monthly income. If minimum monthly payments on a credit card, auto lease, and mortgage (PITI) were $30, $220 and $750 respectively and the gross monthly income was $3000, the debt ratio would be 33.33% ($1000 / $3000). Only debt obligations that will be in place after the loan has funded are considered. Payments for food, utilities, entertainment, medical bills, etc. are not included in the calculation</p>
