<h1>Purchase Money Mortgage
</h1>
<p>A mortgage received by an owner of real property from a new buyer. Similar to a Contract For Deed, except that the Deed is transferred and the owner is selling the property, and taking back a mortgage rather than having the buyer go down to the bank and get a new mortgage to pay off the seller.
